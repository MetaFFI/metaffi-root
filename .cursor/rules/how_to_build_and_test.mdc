# How to build
In the root directory use the file build_target.py to build. Usage:
```
usage: build_target.py [-h] [--build-type {Debug,Release,RelWithDebInfo}] [--clean] [--list]
                       [--verbose]
                       [target]

Build MetaFFI targets

positional arguments:
  target                Target to build

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --build-type {Debug,Release,RelWithDebInfo}
                        Build type
  --clean               Clean build directory before building
  --list                List all available targets
  --verbose             Show detailed build output
```
You should default your build to Debug build-type.

The CMake is built:
- for windows/debug to `cmake-build-debug` directory.
- for ubuntu/debug to `cmake-build-debug-wsl-2204` directory.

MetaFFI output copied to METAFFI_HOME environment variable directory, which must be set.
metaffi-core is built to `METAFFI_HOME`, where each plugin is built into its own directory

# How to test
Run `ctest` from root directory to test.
- to list all tests execute `ctest --test-dir cmake-build-debug --show-only`
- to run all tests (and stop on first failure) execute `ctest --test-dir cmake-build-debug --output-on-failure`
- To run a specific execute `ctest --test-dir cmake-build-debug -R <regex_match_test_name> --output-on-failure`

`cmake-build-debug` can be replaces with the CMake build directory.

You can add the -v switch to output all tests, regarding to their failure.
