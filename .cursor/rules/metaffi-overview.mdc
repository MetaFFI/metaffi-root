# MetaFFI Project Overview

MetaFFI is a sophisticated Multi-Lingual Interoperability System that enables seamless communication between different programming languages. The project consists of several key components:

## Core Components in root directory
- `metaffi-core/`: The central hub that manages language interoperability
- Language Plugins:
- `lang-plugin-python311/`: MetaFFI Python 3.x Plugin
- `lang-plugin-go/`: MetaFFI Go language Plugin
- `lang-plugin-openjdk/`: MetaFFI Java/JVM languages Plugin
- `lang-plugin-c/`: MetaFFI C language Plugin
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Top-level CMake build configuration file that orchestrates the entire MetaFFI project, including its core runtime, language plugins, containers, and installer.
- `build_target.py`: Python script for managing or generating build targets across different environments. It may define or assist in platform-specific build logic.
- ctest is used to execute unit tests and system tests.

## Key Features
- Enables cross-language communication without virtual machines or recompilation
- Supports dynamic loading of modules across different languages
- Uses Foreign Function Interface (FFI) and embedding mechanisms
- Each language runs in its native runtime environment
- Currently supports Python 3.x, Go, and JVM languages

## Project Structure
- `metaffi.github.io/`: Project documentation and website
- `metaffi-installer/`: Installation utilities
- `containers/`: Docker container configurations
- `cmake/`: Additional CMake scripts used in the project
- `output/`: Build output directory seperated by OS, architecture, and build type. For example, Windows, x64, Debug would be: output/windows/x64/Debug/.

## Development Environment
- Uses CMake for cross-platform build system
- Supports Windows and Ubuntu platforms
- Includes IDE configurations for CLion
- Follows C++ code formatting standards (`.clang-format`)

## Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation available at metaffi.github.io
- Github repositories are at github.com/MetaFFI/
- API documentation for each supported language
- Usage examples and tutorials
