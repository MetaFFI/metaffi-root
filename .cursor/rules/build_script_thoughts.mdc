# Build Script Thoughts - CMake Environment Setup for Visual Studio Tools

## Overview
This document captures the learnings and best practices for setting up CMake builds with Visual Studio tools on Windows, specifically addressing the challenge of making environment variables available during both configuration and build phases.

## Key Problem
The main challenge was that environment variables set during CMake configuration phase (`set(ENV{VAR} "value")`) are not automatically inherited by the build system (Ninja) during the build phase. This caused compilation failures with errors like:
- `fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'corecrt.h': No such file or directory`
- `fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'stdint.h': No such file or directory`
- `fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'stdio.h': No such file or directory`
- `LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'kernel32.lib'`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Variable Scope**: `set(ENV{VAR} "value")` only affects the CMake process, not subprocesses spawned by the build system
2. **Build System Isolation**: Ninja runs in a separate process and doesn't inherit environment variables set during CMake configuration
3. **Path Dependencies**: Visual Studio tools require specific environment variables (INCLUDE, LIB, LIBPATH, PATH) to be available during compilation and linking

## Solution: Explicit Compiler/Linker Flags
The most effective CMake-only solution is to convert environment variables into explicit compiler and linker flags that persist to the build phase.

### Implementation in `load_msvc_env` Macro

```cmake
# Convert environment variables to explicit compiler and linker flags
# This ensures the build phase has access to all necessary paths

# Convert INCLUDE to compiler include paths
if(DEFINED ENV{INCLUDE})
    # Split the INCLUDE path and add each as a separate -I flag
    string(REPLACE ";" ";" _include_paths "$ENV{INCLUDE}")
    foreach(_include_path ${_include_paths})
        add_compile_options("-I${_include_path}")
    endforeach()
endif()

# Convert LIB to linker library paths
if(DEFINED ENV{LIB})
    # Split the LIB path and add each as a separate -LIBPATH flag
    string(REPLACE ";" ";" _lib_paths "$ENV{LIB}")
    foreach(_lib_path ${_lib_paths})
        add_link_options("-LIBPATH:${_lib_path}")
    endforeach()
endif()

# Convert LIBPATH to additional linker library paths
if(DEFINED ENV{LIBPATH})
    # Split the LIBPATH and add each as a separate -LIBPATH flag
    string(REPLACE ";" ";" _libpath_paths "$ENV{LIBPATH}")
    foreach(_libpath_path ${_libpath_paths})
        add_link_options("-LIBPATH:${_libpath_path}")
    endforeach()
endif()
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Environment Variable Inheritance
- **Configuration Phase**: Environment variables set with `set(ENV{VAR} "value")` are only available during CMake configuration
- **Build Phase**: Build systems (Ninja, Make) run in separate processes and don't inherit these variables
- **Solution**: Convert environment variables to explicit compiler/linker flags

### 2. String Splitting for Multiple Arguments
- **Problem**: Simple string replacement creates one long quoted argument instead of multiple separate arguments
- **Solution**: Use `foreach` loops to create separate flags for each path
- **Example**: `-Ipath1 -Ipath2 -Ipath3` instead of `"-Ipath1 -Ipath2 -Ipath3"`

### 3. Visual Studio Environment Setup
- **vswhere.exe**: Used to locate Visual Studio installation
- **VsDevCmd.bat**: Sets up the complete Visual Studio environment
- **Key Variables**: INCLUDE, LIB, LIBPATH, PATH, WindowsSdkDir, VCINSTALLDIR

### 4. Compiler and Linker Flag Mapping
- **INCLUDE** → `-I` flags for compiler include paths
- **LIB** → `-LIBPATH:` flags for linker library paths
- **LIBPATH** → Additional `-LIBPATH:` flags for linker library paths

### 5. Global vs Target-Specific Flags
- **Global Flags**: `add_compile_options()` and `add_link_options()` apply to all targets
- **Target Flags**: `target_compile_options()` and `target_link_options()` are appended to global flags
- **Best Practice**: Use global flags for environment setup, target flags for customization

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Batch File Wrappers
- **Problem**: Environment changes in batch files don't propagate back to parent process
- **Result**: Not viable for CMake-only solution

### 2. CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
- **Concept**: Use a launcher script to set environment before each compilation
- **Complexity**: Requires creating and managing launcher programs
- **Result**: Overkill for this use case

### 3. CMAKE_CUSTOM_MAKE_PROGRAM
- **Concept**: Replace Ninja with a custom build program
- **Complexity**: High maintenance overhead
- **Result**: Not practical for standard builds

## Best Practices

### 1. Environment Setup Order
1. Load Visual Studio environment using `load_msvc_env()`
2. Set environment variables for configuration phase
3. Convert to explicit flags for build phase
4. Verify tools are found (`find_program()`)

### 2. Error Handling
- Check if Visual Studio is installed before proceeding
- Verify that `cl.exe` and `rc.exe` are found
- Use `DEFINED ENV{VAR}` to check if environment variables exist

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Only apply Windows-specific logic when `WIN32` is true
- Use platform-agnostic CMake commands where possible

### 4. Debugging
- Use `message(STATUS "...")` to log environment variable values
- Create test targets to verify environment inheritance
- Use verbose build output to inspect actual compiler/linker commands

## MetaFFI-Specific Considerations

### 1. Multi-Language Support
- MetaFFI supports multiple language plugins (Go, Python, OpenJDK, C++)
- Each plugin may have different environment requirements
- The environment setup must work for all supported languages

### 2. Build System Integration
- MetaFFI uses a custom build script (`build_target.py`)
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing build infrastructure
- Should not require changes to individual plugin CMakeLists.txt files

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Environment setup must work for both Debug and Release builds
- Must support different Visual Studio versions and configurations
- Should be tested with different Windows SDK versions

## Conclusion
The key insight is that CMake environment variables don't automatically propagate to the build phase. The solution is to convert environment variables into explicit compiler and linker flags that are passed directly to the build system. This approach is:
- **CMake-only**: No external scripts or tools required
- **Cross-generator**: Works with Ninja, Visual Studio, and other generators
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between configuration and build phases
- **Reliable**: Explicit flags are more predictable than environment variables
