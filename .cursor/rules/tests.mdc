# Unit tests
Unit tests are implemented using multiple unit test libraries, depends on the programming language.

For example:
C++ uses doctest
Python uses pytest
Java uses JUnit
Go uses Go Test

All the different unit tests are executed using CTest

# End-to-End tests
The "api/tests/" in each plugin directory is where the end-to-end tests are implemented! Where language implementation is testing code in different plugin implementation to test end-to-end tests where the tested language is the caller. For example, "lang-plugin-openjdk/api/tests/" implements advanced tests where Java is the host language and the other plugins are guest.
The end-to-end tests are automated by Python scripts

End-to-end tests are also executed by CTest
