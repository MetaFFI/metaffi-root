# MetaFFI Core Framework

Core framework for cross-language function calling with a modular plugin architecture. The project consists of three main components:

1. XLLR (Cross-Language Linker Runtime)
   - Handles runtime linking between languages
   - Manages plugin loading and execution
   - Provides C++ based runtime infrastructure
   - Implements plugin repository and interface wrappers

2. plugin-sdk (shared among metaff-core and all plugins)
   - Provides the SDK for creating language plugins
   - Contains runtime and compiler components
   - Written in Go
   - Defines plugin interfaces and utilities

3. CLI
   - Command line interface for MetaFFI operations
   - Handles plugin management
   - Manages IDL processing
   - Written in C++

Key Development Guidelines:
- All language plugins must implement the plugin-sdk interfaces
- XLLR provides the core runtime infrastructure in C++
- CLI tools are implemented in C++
- Use CMake for building all components
- Follow the .clang-format configuration for C++ code
- Plugin development should be done through the plugin-sdk
- All cross-language communication goes through XLLR
